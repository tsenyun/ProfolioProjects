      - Ensured data accuracy and consistency through validation and transformation techniques.
  - SQL Analysis:
      - Employed **SQL queries (JOIN, Aliases, Aggregation functions, and WHERE clauses)** to analyze the dataset.
      - Generated insights to support data-driven decision-making.
- Usage:
This project is valuable for public health researchers, data analysts, and policymakers seeking to understand the impact of COVID-19 through comprehensive data analysis.

### üè†[Data Cleaning: Nashville Housing](https://github.com/tsenyun/SQL/blob/main/SQL%20Data%20Cleaning%20-%20NashvilleHousing%20Project.sql)
- Description:
The Nashville Housing project focuses on cleaning and preparing a real estate dataset. This project demonstrates the application of SQL for data cleaning and management tasks, ensuring the dataset's readiness for analysis.

- Features:
  - Data Cleaning:
      - Cleaned and managed 56,477 records in the "NashvilleHousing" dataset using **SQL**.
      - Standardized data formats and populated missing values.
      - Splitted address fields into separate columns for better analysis.
      - Converted boolean indicators ('Y' and 'N') into more descriptive terms ('Yes' and 'No').
      - Removed duplicate records and optimized the database structure by deleting unused columns.

- Usage:
This project is essential for data professionals working with real estate datasets, providing practical examples of data cleaning techniques to ensure data quality and consistency.
